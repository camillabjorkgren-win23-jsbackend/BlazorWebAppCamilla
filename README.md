# Blazor Web App Camilla
A web application built using Blazor, showcasing my initial project with this technology. In this application, users can register, log in, change their profile picture, update their password, and join courses. An administrator system(Backoffice) is also available, providing capabilities to create and manage courses.

## Usage
Create a user, wait for the verification code sent to your email provided, login and join courses, manage your profile etc. 
All users created are admins, meaning they can login to the backoffice aswell (for demo purposes only). 
Check out the backoffice system where you can handle the newsletter subscribers, user-roles, create courses etc. 

## Features
- User Management
- Create a new account (registration)
- Log in and log out
- Change profile picture
